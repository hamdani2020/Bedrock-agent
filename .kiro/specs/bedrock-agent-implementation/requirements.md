# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a Bedrock Agent system that provides intelligent analysis and recommendations for industrial equipment monitoring. The agent will serve as an AI-powered maintenance expert that can query historical fault prediction data, analyze patterns, and provide actionable insights to maintenance teams.

The system builds upon existing infrastructure where sensor data flows through ML models to predict equipment faults, with results stored in S3. The agent will make this historical data queryable through natural language interactions, enabling maintenance teams to quickly understand equipment health trends and make informed decisions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Knowledge Base Integration

**User Story:** As a maintenance engineer, I want the agent to have access to historical equipment fault data, so that I can query past incidents and patterns to inform current maintenance decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN historical fault prediction data exists in S3 THEN the system SHALL create a Bedrock Knowledge Base that indexes this data for semantic search
2. WHEN new fault data is added to S3 THEN the Knowledge Base SHALL automatically sync and update its index within 24 hours
3. WHEN the agent receives a query about historical data THEN it SHALL be able to retrieve relevant fault incidents with timestamps, sensor readings, and predictions
4. IF the Knowledge Base contains fault data THEN the agent SHALL be able to search across multiple data dimensions including fault type, date range, sensor values, and risk levels
5. WHEN querying historical patterns THEN the system SHALL return results with proper context including sensor readings, equipment status, and maintenance recommendations

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Query Processing

**User Story:** As a maintenance supervisor, I want to ask natural language questions about equipment health, so that I can quickly understand system status without needing to manually analyze data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about specific fault types THEN the agent SHALL provide detailed analysis including frequency, patterns, and contributing factors
2. WHEN queried about sensor trends THEN the agent SHALL identify correlations between sensor readings and fault occurrences
3. WHEN asked about maintenance timing THEN the agent SHALL analyze historical patterns to recommend optimal maintenance schedules
4. IF a query involves time-based analysis THEN the agent SHALL process date ranges and provide temporal insights
5. WHEN multiple fault types are discussed THEN the agent SHALL compare and contrast their characteristics and risk profiles
6. WHEN asked about root causes THEN the agent SHALL analyze sensor data patterns that preceded fault occurrences

### Requirement 3: Expert Maintenance Recommendations

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want the agent to provide expert-level maintenance recommendations based on current and historical data, so that I can take appropriate preventive actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical fault patterns are identified THEN the agent SHALL provide immediate action recommendations with specific timelines
2. WHEN sensor readings approach fault thresholds THEN the agent SHALL recommend proactive maintenance measures
3. WHEN asked about maintenance priorities THEN the agent SHALL rank recommendations based on risk level and historical failure patterns
4. IF equipment shows degrading performance trends THEN the agent SHALL suggest specific inspection points and maintenance procedures
5. WHEN safety-critical faults are detected THEN the agent SHALL emphasize safety protocols and immediate shutdown procedures if necessary
6. WHEN maintenance schedules are requested THEN the agent SHALL consider equipment criticality, failure history, and operational requirements

### Requirement 4: Pattern Analysis and Insights

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want the agent to identify patterns and trends in equipment behavior, so that I can improve maintenance strategies and prevent future failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing fault frequency THEN the agent SHALL identify seasonal patterns, operational correlations, and equipment-specific trends
2. WHEN examining sensor data THEN the agent SHALL detect early warning indicators that precede equipment failures
3. WHEN comparing time periods THEN the agent SHALL highlight changes in equipment performance and fault patterns
4. IF multiple sensors show correlated behavior THEN the agent SHALL identify systemic issues affecting overall equipment health
5. WHEN analyzing maintenance effectiveness THEN the agent SHALL correlate maintenance actions with subsequent equipment performance
6. WHEN requested THEN the agent SHALL provide statistical insights including failure rates, mean time between failures, and trend analysis

### Requirement 5: Real-time Query Interface

**User Story:** As a maintenance team member, I want to interact with the agent through a conversational interface, so that I can get immediate answers to equipment-related questions during my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the agent SHALL respond within 30 seconds with relevant information
2. WHEN the agent provides responses THEN they SHALL include specific data points, timestamps, and actionable recommendations
3. WHEN follow-up questions are asked THEN the agent SHALL maintain conversation context and provide coherent responses
4. IF a query cannot be answered with available data THEN the agent SHALL clearly explain limitations and suggest alternative approaches
5. WHEN technical terms are used THEN the agent SHALL provide appropriate industrial maintenance terminology and explanations
6. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN each SHALL have independent conversation sessions with proper context isolation

### Requirement 6: Data Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to operate securely with proper access controls, so that sensitive equipment data is protected while remaining accessible to authorized personnel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent accesses S3 data THEN it SHALL use IAM roles with least-privilege permissions
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the agent SHALL only access data within authorized scope and time ranges
3. WHEN storing conversation logs THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data retention and privacy policies
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and deny access appropriately
5. WHEN integrating with existing systems THEN the agent SHALL maintain compatibility with organizational security policies
6. WHEN handling sensitive maintenance data THEN the system SHALL ensure data encryption in transit and at rest

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the agent to perform reliably under varying loads, so that maintenance teams can depend on it for critical decision-making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple concurrent users access the agent THEN response times SHALL remain under 30 seconds for 95% of queries
2. WHEN the Knowledge Base grows with additional data THEN query performance SHALL not degrade significantly
3. WHEN system load increases THEN the agent SHALL maintain availability and gracefully handle capacity limits
4. IF the underlying Bedrock service experiences issues THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages and fallback options
5. WHEN processing complex analytical queries THEN the agent SHALL optimize resource usage and provide progress indicators if needed
6. WHEN integrated into existing workflows THEN the agent SHALL not impact performance of other critical systems

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring of the agent system, so that I can ensure reliable operation and quickly resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent processes queries THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics, response times, and success rates
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information for troubleshooting and resolution
3. WHEN Knowledge Base sync operations run THEN the system SHALL monitor and report on data ingestion status and any failures
4. IF system performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL trigger appropriate alerts to operations teams
5. WHEN analyzing system usage THEN metrics SHALL be available for query patterns, user activity, and resource utilization
6. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL provide health checks and status indicators for all components
