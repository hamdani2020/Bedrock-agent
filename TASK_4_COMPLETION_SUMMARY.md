### ✅ 4. Test basic agent functionality with sample queries
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Implementation**:
- Created comprehensive testing framework in `test_bedrock_agent.py`
- Created `test_existing_agent.py` for testing without alias requirement
- Test queries cover:
  - General preventive maintenance best practices
  - Bearing maintenance and inspection procedures
  - Pump failure signs and prevention
  - Safety protocols during maintenance
  - Equipment criticality-based task prioritization

---
