## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Function Signatures
```python
# Updated to support fault type filtering
def display_chat_interface(api_endpoint: str, equipment_ids: List[str], time_range: str, fault_types: List[str] = None)
def send_query_with_context(api_endpoint: str, query: str, equipment_ids: List[str], time_range: str, fault_types: List[str] = None)
def build_contextual_query(query: str, equipment_ids: List[str], time_range: str, fault_types: List[str] = None)
```

### New Helper Functions
```python
def export_conversation()  # Export chat history as JSON
def perform_health_check(api_endpoint: str)  # System health monitoring
def format_agent_response(response_content: str)  # Enhanced response formatting
def process_agent_response(result: Dict)  # Response processing with limitation detection
```

### Session State Enhancements
```python
# Added comprehensive session tracking
st.session_state.feedback = []  # User feedback collection
st.session_state.session_metadata = {
    'total_queries': 0,
    'successful_responses': 0,
    'error_count': 0,
    'average_response_time': 0.0,
    'last_activity': datetime.now().isoformat()
}
```
