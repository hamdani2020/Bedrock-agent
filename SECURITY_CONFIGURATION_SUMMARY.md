# Security Configuration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the security configuration implemented for the Bedrock Agent system as part of Task 10. The configuration follows security best practices including least-privilege access, secure CORS settings, and proper authentication mechanisms.

## 1. IAM Roles and Policies

### Lambda Execution Role
- **Role Name**: `bedrock-agent-lambda-execution-role`
- **Purpose**: Provides Lambda functions with minimal required permissions
- **Key Security Features**:
  - Restricted to specific log groups (`/aws/lambda/bedrock-agent-*`)
  - Limited Bedrock access to specific agent and knowledge base
  - Conditional access based on region and knowledge base ID
  - S3 access restricted to specific prefix with object tagging requirements

### Bedrock Agent Role
- **Role Name**: `bedrock-agent-service-role`
- **Purpose**: Allows Bedrock Agent to access knowledge base and foundation models
- **Key Security Features**:
  - Access limited to specific knowledge base (ZRE5Y0KEVD)
  - Foundation model access restricted to Claude 3 Sonnet
  - Regional restrictions (us-west-2 only)

### Session Manager Role
- **Role Name**: `bedrock-agent-session-manager-role`
- **Purpose**: Manages conversation sessions with user isolation
- **Key Security Features**:
  - DynamoDB access with leading key conditions for user isolation
  - Attribute-level access controls
  - Limited to session management operations only

## 2. CORS Configuration

### Query Handler Function
```json
{
  "allow_credentials": false,
  "allow_headers": [
    "content-type",
    "x-amz-date", 
    "authorization",
    "x-api-key"
  ],
  "allow_methods": ["POST", "OPTIONS"],
  "allow_origins": [
    "https://localhost:8501",
    "https://*.streamlit.app",
    "https://*.herokuapp.com"
  ],
  "expose_headers": ["x-amz-request-id"],
  "max_age": 300
}
```

### Session Manager Function
```json
{
  "allow_credentials": true,
  "allow_headers": [
    "content-type",
    "authorization",
    "x-amz-date",
    "x-amz-security-token"
  ],
  "allow_methods": ["GET", "POST", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
  "allow_origins": [
    "https://localhost:8501",
    "https://*.streamlit.app", 
    "https://*.herokuapp.com"
  ],
  "max_age": 300
}
```

### Health Check Function
```json
{
  "allow_credentials": false,
  "allow_headers": ["content-type"],
  "allow_methods": ["GET", "OPTIONS"],
  "allow_origins": ["*"],
  "max_age": 86400
}
```

## 3. Authentication Configuration

### Function-Level Authentication
- **Query Handler**: Public access with request validation
- **Session Manager**: IAM authentication required
- **Health Check**: Public access for monitoring
- **Data Sync**: Internal function, no Function URL

### Request Validation
Enhanced Lambda functions include:
- Origin validation against allowed domains
- Input sanitization and length limits
- Request rate limiting through timeout handling
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

## 4. Security Headers

All Lambda responses include security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

## 5. Data Access Controls

### S3 Access Restrictions
- Limited to specific bucket and prefix
- Requires object tagging for environment validation
- IP address restrictions for internal access
- Date-based access controls for data freshness

### DynamoDB Access Controls
- User isolation through leading key conditions
- Attribute-level access restrictions
- Limited to specific table and operations
- Session-based data segregation

### Bedrock Access Controls
- Agent access limited to specific agent ID
- Knowledge base access restricted by ID
- Foundation model access limited to approved models
- Regional access restrictions

## 6. Network Security

### Function URLs
- HTTPS-only access (TLS 1.3)
- Origin validation for cross-origin requests
- Proper CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized access
- Request size limits and timeout handling

### API Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting through Lambda concurrency controls
- Error handling without sensitive information disclosure
- Request logging for security monitoring

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

### Security Logging
- All API requests logged with request IDs
- Authentication failures logged
- Origin validation failures tracked
- Error conditions monitored

### CloudWatch Integration
- Function-specific log groups
- Structured logging for security events
- Metric filters for security monitoring
- Alarm configuration for suspicious activity

## 8. Compliance Features

### Data Protection
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Encryption at rest (S3, DynamoDB)
- No sensitive data in logs
- Proper data retention policies

### Access Auditing
- All API calls logged
- IAM role usage tracked
- Resource access monitored
- Security events recorded

## 9. Security Validation

### Automated Testing
The `validate_security_config.py` script provides:
- IAM role validation
- CORS configuration testing
- Authentication mechanism verification
- Security header validation
- Origin validation testing

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Verify IAM roles have minimal required permissions
2. Test CORS configuration with various origins
3. Validate authentication requirements
4. Check security headers in responses
5. Verify error handling doesn't leak information

## 10. Security Best Practices Implemented

### Least Privilege Access
- ✅ IAM roles have minimal required permissions
- ✅ Resource-specific access controls
- ✅ Conditional access based on context
- ✅ Time-based access restrictions

### Defense in Depth
- ✅ Multiple layers of access control
- ✅ Input validation at multiple levels
- ✅ Network-level restrictions
- ✅ Application-level security

### Secure Configuration
- ✅ CORS properly configured for known origins
- ✅ Security headers prevent common attacks
- ✅ Authentication appropriate for function sensitivity
- ✅ Error handling prevents information disclosure

### Monitoring and Alerting
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for security events
- ✅ Monitoring for suspicious activity
- ✅ Automated validation scripts
- ✅ Health checks for security components

## 11. Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Python 3.11+ with boto3 installed
- Valid AWS credentials with IAM permissions

### Deployment Steps
1. **Configure Security**:
   ```bash
   python configure_security.py
   ```

2. **Validate Configuration**:
   ```bash
   python validate_security_config.py
   ```

3. **Update Lambda Functions**:
   ```bash
   python deploy.py
   ```

4. **Test Security**:
   ```bash
   python test_security_integration.py
   ```

## 12. Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review IAM permissions quarterly
- Update CORS origins as needed
- Monitor security logs for anomalies
- Test security configuration after changes
- Update security headers as standards evolve

### Incident Response
- Security event logging enables rapid response
- Automated monitoring detects suspicious activity
- Clear escalation procedures for security issues
- Regular security assessments and updates

## 13. Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
- CORS wildcard patterns require manual validation
- Some security features require AWS credential refresh
- Regional restrictions may need adjustment for multi-region deployment
- Rate limiting relies on Lambda concurrency controls

### Future Enhancements
- Implement API Gateway for advanced rate limiting
- Add WAF rules for additional protection
- Implement request signing for enhanced security
- Add automated security scanning integration

## 14. Compliance Status

### Requirements Addressed
- **Requirement 6.1**: ✅ IAM roles with least-privilege permissions
- **Requirement 6.2**: ✅ Proper access controls and data encryption
- **Requirement 6.3**: ✅ Security policies and audit logging

### Security Standards
- ✅ OWASP security guidelines followed
- ✅ AWS security best practices implemented
- ✅ Industry-standard encryption and authentication
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and monitoring

This security configuration provides a robust foundation for the Bedrock Agent system while maintaining usability for authorized users and protecting against common security threats.
