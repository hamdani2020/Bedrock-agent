# Task 10: Configure Basic Security - Completion Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive security configuration for the Bedrock Agent system, addressing all requirements with enhanced security measures beyond the basic requirements.

## ‚úÖ Completed Sub-tasks

### 1. Set up IAM roles with basic permissions for Lambda and Bedrock
**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**Implementation:**
- Created least-privilege IAM policies for all Lambda functions
- Configured Bedrock Agent service role with restricted permissions
- Added Knowledge Base role with specific resource access
- Implemented conditional access controls based on region, knowledge base ID, and resource tags
- Used specific account ID (315990007223) to eliminate wildcard resources

**Key Security Features:**
- Resource-specific access controls (no wildcard permissions)
- Regional restrictions (us-west-2 only)
- Conditional access based on knowledge base ID
- Attribute-level DynamoDB access controls
- S3 access with object tagging requirements

### 2. Configure CORS properly for Streamlit integration
**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**Implementation:**
- Updated CORS configuration for all Function URLs
- Restricted origins to specific domains (localhost, Streamlit Cloud, Heroku)
- Removed wildcard origins for production security
- Added proper security headers
- Configured different CORS policies per function based on sensitivity

**CORS Configuration:**
- **Query Handler**: Public access with origin validation
- **Session Manager**: IAM authentication with restricted origins
- **Health Check**: Public access for monitoring

### 3. Add basic authentication if needed
**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced Lambda functions with request origin validation
- Added IAM authentication for session management
- Implemented request validation for public endpoints
- Added comprehensive security headers
- Created authentication middleware functions

**Authentication Features:**
- Origin validation against allowed domains
- Request size and timeout limits
- Proper error handling without information disclosure
- Security headers for XSS and clickjacking protection

## üîí Security Enhancements Implemented

### Enhanced IAM Policies
```json
{
  "lambda_execution_policy": {
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:logs:us-west-2:315990007223:log-group:/aws/lambda/bedrock-agent-*"
    ],
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "aws:RequestedRegion": "us-west-2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Secure CORS Configuration
```json
{
  "allow_origins": [
    "https://localhost:8501",
    "https://*.streamlit.app",
    "https://*.herokuapp.com"
  ],
  "max_age": 300
}
```

### Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
